# Project Guess Who game 

Week 2 project in Technigo Bootcamp. I need to make the popular game "Guess Who" to work using JS, HTML and CSS. 

## The main problem was to understand how to make filtering in the game, as well how to use functions and event listeners in proper time in the code. 

I went many times for documantation and videos that we got with the project to understand how different things work in JS. It was a difficult assigment for week 2 for me, without previous knowledge about programming language. However, will many tries, help from classmates and coding mentors it works in the end.
